## Learnings from the project:-

    - How to build nav bar? ul (list-style-type: none) > li's > a.
    - Before writing CSS, we must dump down all HTML in proper sequence.
    - If thinking of using flexbox or grid, visualize page in terms of rows and columns. 
    - Background image repeats when content size (container) is more than the size of the image. To be at the background, it has no option other than repeating itself.
    - flex: 1 or 2 means proportion of space, element going to take.
    - Putting border on HTML tag shows that there is a room for HTML tag also in page and body comes inside it. We have little margin between body and HTML. Interesting!
    - Default buttons have some border. We make border: none to take it's full control.
    - Opposite of display: none is display: block only. Hehehe.. Usecase: we hide humburger menu icon in big screen using display: none in big screen and show up using display: block in smaller screens.
